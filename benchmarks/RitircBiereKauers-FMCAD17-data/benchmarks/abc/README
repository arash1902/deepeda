These benchmarks are generated with ABC and are essentially a superset of those
those used in the following article (extended version of a DAC'15 paper)

  Cunxi Yu, Walter Brown, Duo Liu, Andr√© Rossi, Maciej J. Ciesielski:
  Formal Verification of Arithmetic Circuits by Function Extraction.
  IEEE Trans. on CAD of Integrated Circuits and Systems 35(12): 2131-2142 (2016).

Except that we provide AIGER versions and more bit-widths.  The process for
the different versions of synthesis (none,resyn,resyn3) as well as using
different libraries for technology mapping should be the same (complex,no-complex)
and was kindly explained by Maciej through EMail.  They also started with a
Verilog version which however seems to produce essentially the same AIG
at the end as the internal ABC command 'gen -m ...' we used.  The original version
(without suffix) actually turns out to have the same structure as the multipliers
synthesized from Boolector in the 'btor' subdirectory.
