These multipliers were generated and obtained from the service provided at:

http://www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/arith/

Two of the larger 128 input (and 256 output) benchmarks were kindly
directly provided by Naofumi Homma via EMail.

If you use these benchmarks, please make sure to use the following
reference in any published material or when distributing them.

  Naofumi Homma, Yuki Watanabe, Takafumi Aoki, Tatsuo Higuchi: Formal Design
  of Arithmetic Circuits Based on Arithmetic Description Language. IEICE
  Transactions 89-A(12): 3500-3509 (2006).

Further, these AIGs were synthesized to AIGER circuits with YoSyS/ABC from
their Verilog specification as follows

  yosys -p "hierarchy -auto-top -check" -p flatten -p techmap -p stat -o mult.blif mult.v

which was the same setting as used in the following paper

  Amr A. R. Sayed-Ahmed, Daniel Große, Ulrich Kühne, Mathias Soeken, Rolf
  Drechsler: Formal verification of integer multipliers by combining Gröbner
  basis with logic reduction. DATE 2016: 1048-1053.

The YoSyS command above was explained by Mathias Soeken via EMail.  Thus
also make sure that you include in any derived work a disclaimer how these
benchmarks were derived and that in particularly the original authors of the
generator for the verilog benchmarks do not provide any kind of warranty for
the correctness of the derived AIGER files.
